This package provides a Wordpress plugin for tools that help with
explaining the structure and operation of Python code, embedded into
the Gutenberg editor.

This package provides just the Gutenberg wrapper, the core functionality
is in the package
[@timmartin2/python-code-analyzer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@timmartin2/python-code-analyzer).
If you want to embed similar tools in places other than Wordpress,
start there.

The Javascript package is published to NPM, but it's not that much use
on its own. Users will probably want to install the package directly as
a Wordpress plugin.
